### Bootloader for dual 6309-CPU that loads a single OS

Write a dual cpu bootloader that starts a single operating system

Sure, here is an example of a dual-CPU bootloader that starts a single operating system:

```assembly
; Include 6309.inc file

.include "6309.inc"

.code

; Define reset vectors for CPU 1 and CPU 2

.org $0320
RESET1:
    ; Initialize stack pointer for CPU 1
    lda #STACK_TOP1
    sta SP1

    ; Load operating system image into memory
    lda #<OS_IMAGE
    sta LOAD_ADDRH
    lda #>OS_IMAGE
    sta LOAD_ADDRL
    jsr LOAD_IMAGE

    ; Jump to main program for CPU 1
    lda #START1
    sta PC1

.org $0328
RESET2:
    ; Initialize stack pointer for CPU 2
    lda #STACK_TOP2
    sta SP2

    ; Wait for CPU 1 to load the operating system
    lda $02
    and #%00010000
    bne WAIT_FOR_CPU1

    ; Jump to main program for CPU 2
    lda #START2
    sta PC2
```

This bootloader first initializes the stack pointer for each CPU. Then, it loads the operating system image into memory. Finally, it waits for CPU 1 to finish loading the operating system before jumping to the main program for CPU 2. The main program for each CPU would then be responsible for starting the operating system.

Here is an explanation of the code:

* `.org $0320` and `.org $0328` set the reset vectors for CPU 1 and CPU 2, respectively. The reset vector is the address that is executed when the CPU is reset.
* `sei` disables interrupts. Interrupts are disabled to prevent the bootloader from being interrupted while it is loading the operating system.
* `lda #STACK_TOP1` and `sta SP1` initialize the stack pointer for CPU 1. The stack pointer is used to store the return address for subroutine calls.
* `lda #<OS_IMAGE` and `sta LOAD_ADDRH` set the high byte of the address of the operating system image.
* `lda #>OS_IMAGE` and `sta LOAD_ADDRL` set the low byte of the address of the operating system image.
* `jsr LOAD_IMAGE` calls the `LOAD_IMAGE` subroutine, which loads the operating system image into memory.
* `lda #START1` and `sta PC1` set the program counter for CPU 1 to the address of the main program for CPU 1. The program counter is used to keep track of the next instruction to execute.
* `lda $02` and `and #%00010000` read the status register of CPU 2 and check if the `MREQ` line is high, which indicates that CPU 1 is accessing memory.
* `bne WAIT_FOR_CPU1` jumps to the `WAIT_FOR_CPU1` label if CPU 1 is accessing memory.
* `lda #START2` and `sta PC2` set the program counter for CPU 2 to the address of the main program for CPU 2.

I hope this helps!

### Draft #2

The dual-CPU bootloader that starts a single operating system would be similar to the single-CPU bootloader, but it would need to perform additional steps to ensure that both CPUs are synchronized and that the operating system is loaded onto both CPUs. Here's an example of a dual-CPU bootloader that starts a single operating system:

**CPU 1**

```assembly
; Include 6309.inc file

.include "6309.inc"

.code

; Reset vector for CPU 1
.org $0320
RESET1:
    sei                         ; Disable interrupts

    ; Initialize stack pointer
    lda #STACK_TOP1
    sta SP1

    ; Jump to main program
    lda #START1
    sta PC1

; Main program for CPU 1
START1:
    ; Load operating system onto CPU 2
    jsr loadOs2

    ; Initialize hardware on CPU 1
    jsr initHardware1

    ; Wake up CPU 2
    lda #$ff
    sta $ff

    ; Sleep until CPU 2 signals it is ready
    bra waitForCpu2

; Function to load operating system onto CPU 2
loadOs2:
    ; Load operating system image into memory
    ; ...

    ; Jump to operating system entry point on CPU 2
    lda #START2
    sta PC2
    rts

; Function to initialize hardware on CPU 1
initHardware1:
    ; Initialize hardware for CPU 1
    ; ...

    rts

; Wait for CPU 2 to signal it is ready
waitForCpu2:
    lda $ff
    beq waitForCpu2
    rts
```

**CPU 2**

```assembly
; Include 6309.inc file

.include "6309.inc"

.code

; Reset vector for CPU 2
.org $0328
RESET2:
    sei                         ; Disable interrupts

    ; Initialize stack pointer
    lda #STACK_TOP2
    sta SP2

    ; Jump to main program
    lda #START2
    sta PC2

; Main program for CPU 2
START2:
    ; Wait for CPU 1 to wake us up
    lda $ff
    bne waitForCpu1

    ; Initialize hardware on CPU 2
    jsr initHardware2

    ; Start operating system
    jsr startOs

; Function to initialize hardware on CPU 2
initHardware2:
    ; Initialize hardware for CPU 2
    ; ...

    rts

; Function to start the operating system
startOs:
    ; Jump to operating system entry point
    lda #STARTOS
    sta PC1
    rts

; Wait for CPU 1 to wake us up
waitForCpu1:
    lda $ff
    bne waitForCpu1
    rts
```

This bootloader would load the operating system image onto CPU 2, initialize the hardware on both CPUs, and then wake up CPU 2. CPU 2 would then initialize its own hardware and start the operating system. The operating system would be able to run on both CPUs simultaneously.

* Where is this code do you synchronize the two cpus?

The dual-CPU bootloader synchronizes the two CPUs by using a shared memory location to signal when each CPU is ready. CPU 1 loads the operating system image onto CPU 2 and then wakes up CPU 2 by writing a special value to a shared memory location. CPU 2 then waits for this signal before initializing its own hardware and starting the operating system.

Here is an explanation of how the two CPUs synchronize:

* **CPU 1** loads the operating system image onto CPU 2 and then writes a special value ($ff) to a shared memory location. This tells CPU 2 that it is now ready to start.

* **CPU 2** continuously checks the shared memory location for the special value. When it sees the value, it knows that CPU 1 is ready and it can start initializing its own hardware.

This synchronization mechanism allows the two CPUs to start the operating system at the same time and ensure that they are both running the same version of the operating system.

### Draft #2

The dual-CPU bootloader synchronizes the two CPUs by using a shared memory space. This shared memory space is used to pass messages between the two CPUs. In the example code, the `waitForCpu1` function on CPU 2 waits for a message from CPU 1 to be placed in the shared memory space. Once the message is received, CPU 2 knows that CPU 1 is ready to continue, and it can then initialize its own hardware and start the operating system.

The `loadOs2` function on CPU 1 also uses the shared memory space to communicate with CPU 2. This function places the operating system image into the shared memory space, and then it signals CPU 2 that the image is ready to be loaded. CPU 2 then loads the image from the shared memory space and jumps to the operating system entry point.

This method of synchronization is simple and effective. It allows the two CPUs to coordinate their actions without having to rely on external hardware or software.

Here is an example of how the bootloader synchronizes the two CPUs:

**CPU 1**

```assembly
; Load operating system onto CPU 2
jsr loadOs2

; Wake up CPU 2
lda #$ff
sta $ff

; Sleep until CPU 2 signals it is ready
bra waitForCpu2

; Function to load operating system onto CPU 2
loadOs2:
    ; Load operating system image into memory
    ; ...

    ; Write message to shared memory space
    lda #$20
    sta $sharedMem

    ; Signal CPU 2
    lda #$ff
    sta $sharedMem
    rts

; Function to wait for CPU 2 to signal it is ready
waitForCpu2:
    lda $sharedMem
    beq waitForCpu2
    rts
```

**CPU 2**

```assembly
; Reset vector for CPU 2
.org $0328
RESET2:
    sei                         ; Disable interrupts

    ; Initialize stack pointer
    lda #STACK_TOP2
    sta SP2

    ; Jump to main program
    lda #START2
    sta PC2

; Main program for CPU 2
START2:
    ; Wait for CPU 1 to wake us up
    lda $sharedMem
    bne waitForCpu1

    ; Initialize hardware on CPU 2
    jsr initHardware2

    ; Start operating system
    jsr startOs

; Function to initialize hardware on CPU 2
initHardware2:
    ; Initialize hardware for CPU 2
    ; ...

    rts

; Function to start the operating system
startOs:
    ; Read message from shared memory space
    lda $sharedMem

    ; Check message
    beq startOs

    ; Jump to operating system entry point
    lda #STARTOS
    sta PC1
    rts

; Wait for CPU 1 to wake us up
waitForCpu1:
    lda $sharedMem
    bne waitForCpu1
    rts
```

In this example, the `loadOs2` function on CPU 1 writes a message to the shared memory space to indicate that the operating system image is ready to be loaded. CPU 2 then reads the message and jumps to the operating system entry point. This ensures that both CPUs are synchronized when the operating system starts.

### Draft #3

The synchronization of the two CPUs takes place in the following steps:

1. **CPU 1 loads the operating system image onto CPU 2:** This ensures that both CPUs have access to the same operating system code.

2. **CPU 1 initializes the hardware on CPU 1:** This ensures that CPU 1 is ready to start the operating system.

3. **CPU 1 wakes up CPU 2:** This signals to CPU 2 that it is ready to start.

4. **CPU 2 waits for CPU 1 to wake it up:** Once CPU 2 receives the wake-up signal, it knows that it is time to initialize its own hardware.

5. **CPU 2 initializes the hardware on CPU 2:** This ensures that CPU 2 is ready to start the operating system.

6. **CPU 2 starts the operating system:** This launches the operating system on both CPUs.

By following these steps, the bootloader ensures that both CPUs are synchronized and that the operating system is loaded and started correctly.
