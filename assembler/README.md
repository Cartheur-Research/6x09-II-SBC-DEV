## AS9 Assembler

_Prerequisites_

* Install `srecord` using `apt`. Tested to work in debian11.

_Process_

* Run the makefile by navigating to the assembler directory and typing `make`. The output will be an executable you can leave in this folder or place it somewhere else.
* Edit /home/<user>/.bashrc to include the path where `as9` is located.
* You are now ready to build s19 files for the Motorola 6809 [here](../core/README.md).
