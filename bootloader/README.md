Write me assembly code bootloader for a dual-cpu 6809 computer. | Sure, here is the assembly code bootloader for a dual-CPU 6809 computer:

```
; Initialize CPU 0

LDX #$0000
LDY #$0000

; Set up stack pointer

STX SP0
STY SP1

; Initialize I/O ports

LDA #$FF
STA DDRA
LDA #$00
STA PORTA

LDA #$FF
STA DDRB
LDA #$00
STA PORTB

; Initialize timer

LDA #$80
STA TCTL1

; Enable interrupts

CLI

; Start CPU 1

BSET #$01,PCON

; Jump to CPU 1 code

JMP $8000
```

This bootloader initializes both CPUs and sets them up for operation. It then enables interrupts and jumps to the CPU 1 code.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

* The `LDX #$0000` and `LDY #$0000` instructions set the X and Y registers to $0000.
* The `STX SP0` instruction stores the value of the X register in the SP0 register, which is the stack pointer for CPU 0.
* The `STY SP1` instruction stores the value of the Y register in the SP1 register, which is the stack pointer for CPU 1.
* The `LDA #$FF` and `STA DDRA` instructions set the data direction register for port A to $FF, which means that all of the pins on port A are outputs.
* The `LDA #$00` and `STA PORTA` instructions set the port A data register to $00, which means that all of the pins on port A are low.
* The `LDA #$FF` and `STA DDRB` instructions set the data direction register for port B to $FF, which means that all of the pins on port B are outputs.
* The `LDA #$00` and `STA PORTB` instructions set the port B data register to $00, which means that all of the pins on port B are low.
* The `LDA #$80` and `STA TCTL1` instructions set the timer control register 1 to $80, which enables the timer and sets it to mode 1.
* The `CLI` instruction clears the interrupt mask register, which enables interrupts.
* The `BSET #$01,PCON` instruction sets the bit 1 of the power control register, which starts CPU 1.
* The `JMP $8000` instruction jumps to the CPU 1 code, which starts executing on CPU 1.

### Draft #2

Sure, here is the assembly code bootloader for a dual-CPU 6809 computer:

```assembly
; This bootloader initializes the two CPUs and then jumps to the main program

        lda #$0
        sta SYSCTL    ; Set system control register to reset both CPUs and disable bus mastering
        lda #$3FF
        sta INITPR    ; Set initial priority register to prevent CPU 0 from running before CPU 1 is initialized
        ldx #$0
        ldy #$0
        stx CPU1S      ; Set CPU 1 start address to $0
        sty CPU1E      ; Set CPU 1 end address to $FFFF
        jsr INITCPU    ; Initialize CPU 1

        ldx #$0
        ldy #$4000
        stx CPU0S      ; Set CPU 0 start address to $4000
        sty CPU0E      ; Set CPU 0 end address to $FFFF
        jsr INITCPU    ; Initialize CPU 0

        jmp MAIN        ; Jump to the main program

INITCPU:
        lda #$0
        sta SYSCTL    ; Set system control register to allow CPU to run
        lda #$0
        sta CPUCR      ; Set CPU control register to disable interrupts and set mode to user

        ; Set data bus and address bus widths
        lda #$0
        sta ADDRWID     ; Set address bus width to 16 bits
        lda #$0
        sta DATAWID     ; Set data bus width to 8 bits

        ; Set PB7 as the bus grant signal
        lda #$80
        sta PBCON      ; Set PBCON to enable output on port B
        lda #$FF
        sta PBOUT      ; Set PB7 high

        ; Jump to the start address
        jmp START

START:
        ; Do something useful here
        lda #$0
        sta SYSCTL    ; Clear system control register to stop both CPUs

        rts
```

This bootloader initializes the two CPUs by setting the system control register, priority register, start address, end address, and control register for each CPU. It then sets the data bus and address bus widths and enables the bus grant signal. Finally, it jumps to the start address of the main program.

The main program can then do anything it needs to do, such as loading an operating system or running applications.
