## In the case of 6309

Show me the 6309.inc file for a dual 6309 cpu computer

Here's a sample `6309.inc` file for a dual 6309 CPU computer:

```assembly
; Define register addresses for CPU 1

; Registers
A1           = $00       ; Accumulator A for CPU 1
B1           = $01       ; Accumulator B for CPU 1
CC1           = $02       ; Condition code register for CPU 1
D1           = $03       ; Data register for CPU 1
X1           = $04       ; X-index register for CPU 1
Y1           = $05       ; Y-index register for CPU 1
SP1           = $07       ; Stack pointer for CPU 1
PC1           = $08       ; Program counter for CPU 1

; Interrupt vectors for CPU 1
IRQ1          = $200       ; Interrupt Request vector for CPU 1
NMI1          = $208       ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector for CPU 1
RESET1        = $210       ; Reset vector for CPU 1

; Memory locations for CPU 1
STACK_TOP1    = $ffff       ; Top of stack for CPU 1
START1        = $0000       ; Start of program for CPU 1

; Define register addresses for CPU 2

; Registers
A2           = $f8       ; Accumulator A for CPU 2
B2           = $f9       ; Accumulator B for CPU 2
CC2           = $fa       ; Condition code register for CPU 2
D2           = $fb       ; Data register for CPU 2
X2           = $fc       ; X-index register for CPU 2
Y2           = $fd       ; Y-index register for CPU 2
SP2           = $ff       ; Stack pointer for CPU 2
PC2           = $10       ; Program counter for CPU 2

; Interrupt vectors for CPU 2
IRQ2          = $204       ; Interrupt Request vector for CPU 2
NMI2          = $212       ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector for CPU 2
RESET2        = $218       ; Reset vector for CPU 2

; Memory locations for CPU 2
STACK_TOP2    = $ffff       ; Top of stack for CPU 2
START2        = $0004       ; Start of program for CPU 2
```

This `6309.inc` file defines separate sections for CPU 1 and CPU 2, specifying the register addresses, interrupt vectors, and memory locations for each CPU. This allows you to access and manipulate the registers and memory locations of each CPU independently.
