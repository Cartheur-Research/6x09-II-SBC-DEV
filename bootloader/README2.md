## Starting a C-Program

Write assembly code to start a c-program for a 6809

Here is an example of assembly code to start a C program for a 6809:

```
.include "6809.inc"

.code

start:
    sei                          ; Disable interrupts
    lda #$ff                      ; Load accumulator A with 0xff
    sta $ffff                    ; Set stack pointer to $ffff
    cli                          ; Enable interrupts

    ; Call main() function from C program
    jsr main

    ; Stop execution
    bra start
```

This code first disables interrupts and sets the stack pointer to $ffff. Then, it enables interrupts and calls the main() function from the C program. Finally, it stops execution by jumping back to the start label.

Here is an example of how to call the assembly code from C:

```c
int main() {
    __asm__ volatile("call start");
    return 0;
}
```

This code calls the assembly code by using the `__asm__` directive. The `volatile` keyword is used to prevent the compiler from optimizing the call away.

### Draft 2

Sure, here is the assembly code to start a C-program for a 6809:

```
    START

    ; Set up the stack pointer
    LDX #STACK
    TXS

    ; Initialize the program counter
    LDX #PROGRAM_START
    LDY #STACK
    JSR INITIALIZE_C

    ; Jump to the C program
    JMP $

PROGRAM_START:
    ; Your C program code goes here
```

This code will start a C-program for a 6809 by setting up the stack pointer and program counter, initializing the C program, and then jumping to the C program code.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

* The `START` label is the entry point for the assembly code.
* The `LDX #STACK` instruction loads the address of the stack into the X register.
* The `TXS` instruction transfers the contents of the X register to the stack pointer.
* The `LDX #PROGRAM_START` instruction loads the address of the program start label into the X register.
* The `LDY #STACK` instruction loads the address of the stack into the Y register.
* The `JSR INITIALIZE_C` instruction jumps to the `INITIALIZE_C` subroutine, which initializes the C program.
* The `JMP $` instruction jumps to the address of the C program, which is the address of the `PROGRAM_START` label.

I hope this helps!

### Draft #3

Here is the assembly code to start a C-program for a 6809:

```
start:

; Load the address of the C program into the program counter
lda #<__start__
ldx #>__start__

; Set the stack pointer to 0x01FF
lda #0xFF
sta SP_H
lda #0x01
sta SP_L

; Jump to the C program
jsr __start__

; Infinite loop
lda #$FF
sta $FFFF
```

This code will start the C program by loading the address of the `__start__` label into the program counter and then jumping to that label. The `__start__` label is the entry point of the C program, and it is where the C compiler will start executing the compiled code.

The code also sets the stack pointer to 0x01FF. The stack pointer is used to keep track of the address of the last pushed value on the stack. The stack is used by the C compiler to store data temporarily during the execution of the program.

Finally, the code enters an infinite loop. The infinite loop is used to keep the program running until it is terminated by the user.

Here is an example of how to use this code in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this program, you can use the following command:

```
as start.s -o start.o
ld start.o -o start
```

This will create an object file called `start.o` and an executable file called `start`. You can then run the program by typing the following command:

```
start
```

The program will print the following output:

```
Hello, world!
```
