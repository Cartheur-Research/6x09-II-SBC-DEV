### The file itself

Generate the 6809.inc file you mentioned.

The `6809.inc` file is a standard include file for Motorola 6809 assembly language programming. It contains definitions for various register addresses, memory locations, and constants. Here's a sample `6809.inc` file:

```assembly
; Define register addresses

; Registers
A           = $00       ; Accumulator A
B           = $01       ; Accumulator B
CC           = $02       ; Condition code register
D           = $03       ; Data register
X           = $04       ; X-index register
Y           = $05       ; Y-index register
SP           = $07       ; Stack pointer
PC           = $08       ; Program counter

; Interrupt vectors
IRQ          = $0310    ; Interrupt Request vector
NMI          = $0318    ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector
RESET        = $0320    ; Reset vector

; Memory locations and constants
STACK_TOP    = $ffff    ; Top of stack
START        = $0000    ; Start of program
```

This `6809.inc` file defines basic register addresses, interrupt vectors, and memory locations commonly used in 6809 assembly language programming. You can include this file in your assembly code to access these addresses and constants directly.

### In the case of duals

Assuming you have two 6809 CPUs on the same system, you would need to define two separate `6809.inc` files, one for each CPU. Each file would need to define the register addresses and memory locations for that particular CPU. Here's an example of how to define the register addresses and memory locations for two 6809 CPUs:

**CPU 1**

```assembly
; Define register addresses for CPU 1

; Registers
A1           = $00       ; Accumulator A for CPU 1
B1           = $01       ; Accumulator B for CPU 1
CC1           = $02       ; Condition code register for CPU 1
D1           = $03       ; Data register for CPU 1
X1           = $04       ; X-index register for CPU 1
Y1           = $05       ; Y-index register for CPU 1
SP1           = $07       ; Stack pointer for CPU 1
PC1           = $08       ; Program counter for CPU 1

; Interrupt vectors for CPU 1
IRQ1          = $0310    ; Interrupt Request vector for CPU 1
NMI1          = $0318    ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector for CPU 1
RESET1        = $0320    ; Reset vector for CPU 1

; Memory locations for CPU 1
STACK_TOP1    = $ffff    ; Top of stack for CPU 1
START1        = $0000    ; Start of program for CPU 1
```

**CPU 2**

```assembly
; Define register addresses for CPU 2

; Registers
A2           = $0f       ; Accumulator A for CPU 2
B2           = $10       ; Accumulator B for CPU 2
CC2           = $11       ; Condition code register for CPU 2
D2           = $12       ; Data register for CPU 2
X2           = $13       ; X-index register for CPU 2
Y2           = $14       ; Y-index register for CPU 2
SP2           = $17       ; Stack pointer for CPU 2
PC2           = $18       ; Program counter for CPU 2

; Interrupt vectors for CPU 2
IRQ2          = $0314    ; Interrupt Request vector for CPU 2
NMI2          = $0322    ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector for CPU 2
RESET2        = $0328    ; Reset vector for CPU 2

; Memory locations for CPU 2
STACK_TOP2    = $ffff    ; Top of stack for CPU 2
START2        = $0004    ; Start of program for CPU 2
```

These `6809.inc` files would allow you to access the register addresses and memory locations for each CPU independently.
