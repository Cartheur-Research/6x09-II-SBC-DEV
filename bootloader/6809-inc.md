### The file itself

Generate the 6809.inc file you mentioned.

The `6809.inc` file is a standard include file for Motorola 6809 assembly language programming. It contains definitions for various register addresses, memory locations, and constants. Here's a sample `6809.inc` file:

```assembly
; Define register addresses

; Registers
A           = $00       ; Accumulator A
B           = $01       ; Accumulator B
CC           = $02       ; Condition code register
D           = $03       ; Data register
X           = $04       ; X-index register
Y           = $05       ; Y-index register
SP           = $07       ; Stack pointer
PC           = $08       ; Program counter

; Interrupt vectors
IRQ          = $0310    ; Interrupt Request vector
NMI          = $0318    ; Non-Maskable Interrupt vector
RESET        = $0320    ; Reset vector

; Memory locations and constants
STACK_TOP    = $ffff    ; Top of stack
START        = $0000    ; Start of program
```

This `6809.inc` file defines basic register addresses, interrupt vectors, and memory locations commonly used in 6809 assembly language programming. You can include this file in your assembly code to access these addresses and constants directly.
